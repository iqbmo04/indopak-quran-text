# Naskh Nastaleeq IndoPak Quran Text

This repository contains the Naskh Nastaleeq IndoPak text used on [Quranwbw.com](https://quranwbw.com). This is the highly improved version of the normal IndoPak text found online and was made to closely resemble the actual IndoPak mushaf including the pause marks and rounded ayah icons. If you are planning to use this text, make sure to only use the font provided in this repository and not the normal Al Qalam Quran font.

You can check it out online at either [Quranwbw.com](https://quranwbw.com) (change the word type from the settings) or [indopak.quranwbw.com](https://indopak.quranwbw.com). You can also use the [Quranwbw.com's Words API](https://api.quranwbw.com) which returns this IndoPak text in both word-by-word and complete ayah formats.
